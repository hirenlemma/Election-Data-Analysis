# A Multifaceted Analysis of Trends in Voter Data


This project will analyze trends in election data and to what extent they are
affected by race, ethnicity, region, historical trends, and other similar
factors. Further inferences can be drawn by charting data over the course of
multiple years and election cycles. As the most recent election season is upon
us, analyses of electoral trends, especially in conversations surrounding voter
suppression and wider societal equity, are more vital than ever. The current
political atmosphere in the United States is as conducive for critical
historical analysis as–if not more so than–any other period in recent history.
